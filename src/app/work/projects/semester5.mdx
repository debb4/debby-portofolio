summary: "I collected a dataset of fruit images with variations in ripeness levels, lighting conditions, and backgrounds. Subsequently, I performed preprocessing steps including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance the dataset quality. Following this, I conducted image segmentation and feature extraction processes. Finally, I ensured the model's output could be effectively integrated with the robotic system for automated harvesting operations."
