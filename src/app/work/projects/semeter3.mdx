## Overview

I developed a user authentication system (login and registration) with strong security measures, including password hashing and token-based authentication (JWT). Additionally, I integrated the login and registration pages with a database to securely and efficiently store and verify user data.

## Key Features

- Build a user authentication system (login and register) with strong security measures, including password hashing and token usage.
- Integrate the login and register pages with a database to store and verify user data.This allowed developers to focus more on logic and less on repetitive UI coding.

## Technologies Used

- Laravel
- PHP
- Bootstrap
- MySQL
- Figma
- UI/UX Design
- Dart
- Flutter
